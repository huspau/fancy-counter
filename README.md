# Fancy Counter

## Overview
This react project app is based on ByteGrad's react course and it allows you to use a counter from 0 to 5. You can reset the counter as well. Once you go 5, the app is locked and ask you to buy a pro version. (There isn't a way to buy a pro version it's just for demo.) You can reset the counter to unlock the counter again.

## How to install and run
To run the project, do the following steps:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open your favorite browser and type: `http://localhost:5173/`
